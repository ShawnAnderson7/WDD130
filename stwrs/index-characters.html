                <p>Jango Fett was a mandalorian bounty hunter who was known as the best bounty hunter during the final years of the Galactic Republic. Shortly after the invasion of Naboo, Fett was hired by Darth Tyranus to be the genetic foundation for the soon to be Republic Clone Army. His only condition was that he wanted one clone unaltered by the sped up aging that he could take as his own and call his son. That son later became Boba Fett</p>

                <p>Ahsoka Tano was a female Togruta who was a Force-sensitive outcast from the Jedi Order. After the Clone Wars, she helped establish a network of various rebel cells against the Galactic Empire. Tano was discovered on her homeworld of Shili by Jedi Master Plo Koon, who brought her to the Jedi Temple on Coruscant to receive Jedi training. Following the outbreak of the Clone Wars, Jedi Grand Master Yoda assigned the young Tano to be the Padawan learner of Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker, who nicknamed her "Snips". They had a bit of a rough start as a team, but after they were able to put their pride aside they became as close as father and daughter</p>

                <p>Darth Sidious, born Sheev Palpatine and also simply known as The Emperor, was a male human Dark Lord of the Sith and Emperor of the Galactic Empire, with his reign lasting from 19 BBY to 4 ABY. Rising to power in the Galactic Senate as the senator of Naboo, the secretive Sith Lord cultivated two identities, Sidious and Palpatine, using both to further his political career and deceive his way into accomplishing his goal. He orchestrated the fall of the Galactic Republic and the Jedi Order through the Clone Wars, and then established his reign over the galaxy which lasted until his death at the Battle of Endor.</p>
