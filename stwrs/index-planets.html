                    <h2>Endor</h2>
                    <p>Endor, also known as the Forest Moon of Endor or the Sanctuary Moon, was a small forested moon that was the ninth moon that orbited the Outer Rim planet of the same name. It was the homeworld of the sentient Dulok, Ewok, and Yuzzum species, as well as the Wistie and semi-sentient Gorax races. During the reign of the Galactic Empire, the Empire, deeming Endor to be perfect for its purposes due to how remote the moon was, established an outpost on the moon that included a shield generator complex to protect the incomplete second Death Star in orbit of the moon. The Empire occupied Endor. In order to make way for the complex, an Ewok village was razed by Imperial troops, leading to strained Imperialâ€”Ewok relations. As a result of the repulsorlift field emitted by the SLD-26 planetary shield generator to keep the Death Star in a stationary orbit, Endor was prone to earthquakes, tidal imbalances, and other geological disturbances that slowly but surely began to break up the small moon. The Tarkin Initiative also established Research Station 9 on the moon. The moon was later the site of the monumental Battle of Endor that saw combat between the Alliance to Restore the Republic and its Ewok allies against Imperial forces who were attempting to protect the shield generator and prevent the Alliance from destroying its superweapon in orbit. After fierce combat on the forest moon, the Rebel Alliance managed not only to destroy the shield generator complex, but also the second Death Star. With the destruction of the Empire's dreaded battle station and the death of Emperor Palpatine and his enforcer, Darth Vader, the rebels and Ewoks held a victory celebration on the moon, one of many across the galaxy</p>

                    <h2>Mustafar</h2>
                    <p>Mustafar was a young, small planet located in the Mustafar system, within the Atravis sector of the galaxy's Outer Rim Territories. Once a garden world nourished by the Bright Star artifact, its orbit was shifted when Lady Corvax unleashed the energies of the Bright Star in an attempt to return her husband to life. The resulting gravimetric duel between the gas giants Jestefad and Lefrani over Mustafar heated the planet's core, transforming the lush world into an imbalanced volcanic hellscape. Adapting to life on their devastated homeworld, the arthropodal Mustafarians evolved into two distinct subspecies that cooperated to ensure their continued survival. Legends of Corvax's search for immortality brought the ancient Sith to Mustafar, seeking the same secrets of eternal life. There, they built a temple over a locus in the dark side of the Force, above the buried ruins of Corvax Fortress.</p>

                    <h2>Mandalore</h2>
                    <p>Mandalore, also known as Mand'alor, was a planet located in the Outer Rim Territories. It was the homeworld of the Mandalorians, a fearsome warrior clan-based people, and the indigenous Alamite species. The Mandalorians once fought the Jedi and raided their temple during the fall of the Old Republic. Wearing distinctive armor that was often made from beskar, they were feared throughout the galaxy, and once had political influence over two thousand other star systems. Many years of war left the planet inhospitable, forcing the Mandalorians to live within domed cities. A pacifist regime came to power at the end of these wars, led by Duchess Satine Kryze, who joined the Galactic Republic. The Mandalorian Civil War was fought between the pacifists and the martial traditionalists. The Civil War ended in a victory for the New Mandalorians, and those who refused to give up their warrior ways were exiled to the moon Concordia, and believed to have died out.</p>
